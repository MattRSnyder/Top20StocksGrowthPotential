# Top 20 U.S. Stocks (by market cap) Growth Potential
An analysis of the top 20 stocks in the U.S. by market cap to see which stocks have the most potential for growth over the next ten years.

Project Background Info:

I recently made a career change and wanted to start focusing on investing for my future more. For this analysis I wanted to know where I can diversify my portfolio so that it has the most growth potential possible.

Steps:

Ask
“How does Secratariat’s finishing times stack up against the other horses in the modern-era?”

Prepare
I searched through multiple databases to cross-reference and compare to find the most accurate and complete dataset which led me to https://horseracingdatasets.com/ This site was created in 2015 since there was a real need to have a complete database of all of the horses and their respective races. Jessica Chapel, a leading expert in the field, played the biggest role in ensuring the database is accurate and complete http://jessicachapel.com/

The type of data I was needing in order to complete this analysis was the races top finishing times, the winning horse and the year which this site luckily had all of that information.

Process
After double checking the datasets for outliers and missing data, I removed uneccessary columns and rows including, years prior to 1940, sire, dam, notes and the distance. Then I merged all three of the races datasets into one Excel file.

Next Steps
When I come back to this project I want to slim it down even more to which of the stocks with the most growth potential are the most recession proof too? This would require many more years of data comparing how they performed in prior recessions and their more recent growth trends.
